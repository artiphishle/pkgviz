# Changelog

## 21.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 1108e6a: Update Ankhorage dependencies: `@ankhorage/surface`.

## 21.0.1

### Patch Changes

- a9b8d75: Forward constrained layout props through Tabs and TabPanel to the released Surface owner contract.

## 21.0.0

### Major Changes

- 163c605: Materialize web components with one shared ZoraProvider runtime and add project-scoped create/sync reconciliation.

## 20.5.1

### Patch Changes

- d2308a3: Recover uniformly cramped GraphView layouts when an explicit optimized fit detects overlapping node or label bounds.

## 20.5.0

### Minor Changes

- e5796f8: Add opt-in readable graph zoom bounds and an automatic-fit label-size cap. Explicit fit can compact settled node positions with bounded measured collision checks, preserving compound containment, node sizes, edges and layout ordering. Report the accepted spacing to controlled consumers without relayout on acknowledgement. Ordinary zoom never compacts or reruns the layout.

## 20.4.1

### Patch Changes

- 02d52d8: Size GraphView self-loops around actual node bounds so wide labels and compound nodes retain valid edge endpoints. Default TreeView expansion controls to folder icons while keeping chevrons configurable.

## 20.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 7a2dfec: Add opt-in fit-relative GraphView zoom and renderer-measured plain-label sizing. Keep logical zoom stable across layout spacing changes without repeating text measurement on viewport events. Move TreeView expansion controls before labels and allow chevron or folder/file indicators independently of selection.

## 20.3.8

### Patch Changes

- 0f5c8ea: Isolate asynchronous ELK layouts from disposed or superseded browser graphs, preserve node selection and positions during updates, avoid relayout for presentation-only changes, and refit changed graph topology after layout completion.

## 20.3.7

### Patch Changes

- 1da4532: Make materialized public web components install their responsive runtime inside each standalone
  bundle so generated AppBar, typography, form, and navigation artifacts render without consumer-side
  Surface providers.

## 20.3.6

### Patch Changes

- 7a99f2c: Update Ankhorage dependencies: `@ankhorage/surface`.

## 20.3.5

### Patch Changes

- 2c51405: Update Ankhorage dependencies: `@ankhorage/contracts`, `@ankhorage/surface`.

## 20.3.4

### Patch Changes

- 8d6a5b3: Keep GraphView ELK browser-safe by adapting the source layout class to Cytoscape's function-style extension contract and reject leaked CommonJS runtime dependencies from generated web artifacts.

## 20.3.3

### Patch Changes

- e34f1b0: Fix the materialized GraphView ELK layout by registering the transpiled Cytoscape adapter instead of its native-class source entry.

## 20.3.2

### Patch Changes

- 2ab43e2: Preserve GraphView zoom and pan across subsequent layout generations such as layout-spacing changes, while retaining the initial automatic fit and explicit controller-driven fitting.

## 20.3.1

### Patch Changes

- d3432fb: Restore GraphView to generic web artifact discovery through its canonical feature facade.

## 20.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 2f745fe: Discover public runtime exports under `src/features/**/public.ts` automatically and publish each
  one as a materializable standalone web artifact, while preserving specialized TreeView and GraphView
  browser adapters by convention.

## 20.2.5

## 20.1.1

### Patch Changes

- c9f2c5d: Emit web-only component artifacts with React's production JSX runtime so Next.js SSR consumers can prerender them safely.

## 20.1.0

### Minor Changes

- e915d65: Add Ankh CLI web-only component materialization, starting with TreeView, and wire TreeView default-row selection and icons.

## 20.0.2

- 58395d6: Update Ankhorage dependencies: `@ankhorage/contracts`, `@ankhorage/surface`.

## 20.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 61dec14: Update Ankhorage dependencies: `@ankhorage/color-theory`, `@ankhorage/contracts`, `@ankhorage/paradox`.

## 20.0.0

### Major Changes

- 6fbcac7: Migrate published component requirement metadata to the canonical Contracts 22 serializable set representation.

## 19.0.1

### Patch Changes

- f223d26: Migrate theme scoping and color catalogs to the public Surface v9 boundaries, use Utility's canonical deep equality helper, and normalize source ownership for theme, authoring, plugin, registry, and reusable types.

## 19.0.0

### Major Changes

- 5aaa4ae: Eliminate the legacy `src/patterns` ownership root. Move retained capabilities under canonical `src/features` owners, replace `SwitchField` with the Surface-aligned `Switch` API, and remove redundant convenience APIs including `ConfirmDialog`, `FilterBar`, `InspectorField`, `Notice`, `Panel`, and `ThemeComposer`.

## 18.0.1

### Patch Changes

- a68a5fc: Migrate interactive ZORA consumers from the removed Surface `ButtonBase` API to the native-aligned `Pressable` API and require `@ankhorage/surface` 8.

## 18.0.0

### Major Changes

- 57e6020: Align form and list capabilities with Surface 7. Rename FormField to Field and ListRow to ListItem, move list ownership into src/features/list, and compose Surface Field, List, and ListItem directly without compatibility aliases.

## 17.0.0

### Major Changes

- ecc165a: Adopt the released Surface 6 native-named layout boundary. `View`, `ScrollView`, `Grid`, and `Divider` are the canonical ZORA layout primitives, while `AppShell`, `Screen`, and `ScreenSection` now live under the layout feature.

  Remove the redundant `Box`, `Stack`, `Container`, `Center`, `Inline`, `Spacer`, and `Show` exports together with the specialized `SettingsLayout`, `SidebarLayout`, and `TopbarLayout` wrappers. Replace `TileGrid` with `Grid` and `SettingsRow` with `ListRow`; `ContentRail` and `PaletteItem` retain their public names under dedicated feature owners.

  Update the component registry, authoring metadata, examples, acceptance coverage, and generated Paradox documentation for the new Surface 6 architecture.

## 16.0.0

### Major Changes

- 08a7095: Finish ZORA feature ownership by replacing `Modal` with `Dialog`, `SearchBar` with `SearchInput`, removing `ToolbarAction`, rebuilding Tabs on the released Surface tab primitives, and migrating Pagination, Rating, and Toolbar out of `src/components`.

## 15.0.0

### Major Changes

- 3add861: Adopt `@ankhorage/surface` 5, replace `Menu` and `DropdownMenu` with `PopoverMenu`, make AppBar overflow a real action menu, migrate Breadcrumbs and Select to feature ownership and direct manifest nodes, and present Select with Popover on web and BottomSheetFlatList on native without `@react-native-picker/picker`.

## 14.0.1

### Patch Changes

- be83fc0: Move AppBar into canonical `src/features/app-bar` ownership while preserving the public root API, and expand the Paradox Usage source with toast, adaptive picker, and direct native BottomSheet examples.

## 14.0.0

### Major Changes

- 1b21ad4: Make toast and native bottom-sheet runtime hosts explicit `ZoraProvider` capabilities, migrate Toast to feature ownership, and render DatePicker/TimePicker through platform-specific hosts with BottomSheet on native and Popover on web.

  BREAKING CHANGE: `ZoraProvider` no longer installs `BottomSheetProvider` automatically. Native apps using BottomSheet-backed interactions must enable `<ZoraProvider bottomSheet>`. Enable `<ZoraProvider toast>` or pass toast provider options when descendants use `useToast()`.

## 13.0.0

### Major Changes

- c2e5080: Replace the legacy `DisclosureSection` pattern with feature-owned `Accordion` and `AccordionItem` manifest components backed by the published Surface accordion foundation.

  BREAKING CHANGE: `DisclosureSection` and `DisclosureSectionProps` are no longer exported. Use `Accordion` with one or more `AccordionItem` children instead.

## 12.1.0

### Minor Changes

- ca23e34: Move the complete Auth solution and Gradient to canonical feature ownership.

  ForgotPasswordForm, OtpForm, SignInForm, SignUpForm, OAuthProviderButton, OAuthProviderList, and Gradient are now direct manifest nodes with serializable authoring metadata. Gradient remains renderer-agnostic through GradientRendererProvider.

## 12.0.0

### Major Changes

- b8d1281: Move DatePicker, TimePicker, Hero, MissingElement, and the Skeleton loading building blocks to canonical feature ownership.

  DatePicker and TimePicker are now direct manifest nodes backed by the shared Surface BottomSheet controller. DatePicker values, bounds, and change events now use local `YYYY-MM-DD` strings instead of `Date` objects so manifest state remains JSON serializable.

  Skeleton components are now direct manifest nodes for custom loading layouts. DataTable also continues to render SkeletonList automatically while loading.

## 11.0.0

### Major Changes

- 70a48ec: Replace the config-driven `Form` API with compositional `Form`, `FormField`, and `FormError` manifest nodes under canonical feature ownership.

  `Form` now accepts `FormField` and global `FormError` children instead of `fields`, `values`, `onChange`, `errors`, `error`, and `footer`. Compose each control explicitly inside a `FormField`, keep field errors on `FormField.errorText`, and place global submission errors directly inside `Form`. The submit callback no longer receives values; controlled field state remains owned by the consumer.

  Email rules now use the shared `@ankhorage/utility/regex` validation semantics.

## 10.0.0

### Major Changes

- 8e3d5db: Add a manifest-authorable KeyboardAvoidingView feature backed by the Surface layout primitive, and
  remove the obsolete React-rendered SplashScreen API.

## 9.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 558c64e: Use package metadata as the default Paradox documentation title and description.

## 9.0.0

### Major Changes

- bb78e49: Move EmptyState and progress nodes to feature owners, add form and feedback manifest nodes, and replace the Input and Textarea APIs with TextInput configurations.

## 8.0.0

### Major Changes

- 0ee7355: Move selected UI elements into cohesive feature owners and complete their manifest authoring metadata and bindings. Add native FlatList and SectionList adapters, a declarative BottomSheet, controlled Uploader action events, and intrinsic-width ContentRail scrolling for chips and mixed content.

## 7.0.0

### Major Changes

- 75d39e6: Replace `ImagePreview` and `ImageUploadField` with the canonical `Image` asset renderer and generic `Uploader`, backed by Expo image and document pickers.

## 6.0.0

### Major Changes

- 8ceb824: Integrate the Surface 4 BottomSheet runtime into `ZoraProvider`, expose the supported controller API
  through `@ankhorage/zora/bottom-sheet`, migrate the date and time pickers, and remove the obsolete
  `ActionSheet` and `ActionSheetItem` exports. Expo hosts must now install the gesture-handler,
  Reanimated, and Worklets peers and own `GestureHandlerRootView` outside `ZoraProvider`.

## 5.0.0

### Major Changes

- 44914bc: Remove obsolete navigation and UI chrome APIs now owned by `@ankhorage/navigator`: `Drawer`,
  `NavigationItem`, `NavigationList`, `ResponsivePanel`, `ZoraDrawerContent`, and `ZoraTabBar`.

## 4.5.0

### Minor Changes

- f53e341: Add SVG icon options, equal-width columns and content orientation to RadioGroup. Support local initial selection through defaultValue, accessible icon radio controls on web and native, and a directly insertable Radio button group blueprint for Studio.

## 4.4.1

- de3246c: Update Ankhorage dependencies: `@ankhorage/contracts`.

## 4.2.1

### Patch Changes

- de3246c: Update Ankhorage dependencies: `@ankhorage/contracts`.

## 4.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 3dbdeb2: Allow standalone media-backed Icon nodes and permit Icon and Image in screen containers so generated templates can use their separate SVG and raster assets.

## 4.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 39967b9: Expose SVG `source` rendering through the existing ZORA `Icon` component.

## 4.0.0

### Major Changes

- 92c375f: Add a pure `@ankhorage/zora/theme` compiler that returns canonical Color Theory evidence, resolved Surface semantics, measurable selection results, diagnostics, and provenance for both theme modes. Replace the previously unconstructed computed-theme type shape with the compiler's real result.

## 3.3.4

### Patch Changes

- ea5a57d: Update Ankhorage dependencies: `@ankhorage/surface`.

## 3.3.3

### Patch Changes

- 9342fb9: Update Ankhorage dependencies: `@ankhorage/color-theory`, `@ankhorage/contracts`, `@ankhorage/surface`.

## 3.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 0295f82: Update Ankhorage dependencies: `@ankhorage/surface`.

## 3.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 62c1c68: Add a manifest-authorable ContentRail pattern with responsive item sizing, touch scrolling, accessible controls, RTL behavior, and reduced-motion support.

## 3.2.0

### Minor Changes

- ff90f8c: Add a manifest-authorable, accessible ProgressRing with semantic colors and serializable center content.

## 3.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 49c768e: Update Ankhorage dependencies: `@ankhorage/surface`.

## 3.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 10bf7ac: Add the adapter-neutral, manifest-authorable `ReaderSurface` for controlled EPUB and PDF reader experiences, including normalized events, progress and navigation chrome, renderer/action slots, bindable metadata, accessible live page announcements, and a static showcase example.

## 3.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 52d0916: Update `@ankhorage/surface` to include the Web overlay pointer-interaction fix.

## 3.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 7e0ae67: Support the React Native 0.86 patch line as a peer, consume the released Surface peer fix, and align ZORA's validation and Expo 57 examples with React Native 0.86.3.

## 3.0.0

### Major Changes

- 060451e: Move ZORA to the React 19.2.3, React Native 0.86.2, React Native Web 0.21, and
  Surface 3 platform. Icons now use Surface's discriminated scoped-RNVI contract,
  including explicit FontAwesome5/6 variants, and Expo vector-icon/font peers are
  removed.

  Gradient rendering is now host-injected through `GradientRendererProvider`, so
  the portable ZORA runtime no longer requires `expo-linear-gradient`. Expo apps
  can adapt that package at their application boundary.

## 2.13.2

### Patch Changes

- 954029e: Add an explicit fill sizing mode to SidebarLayout so bounded shells can preserve child-owned
  scrolling while existing content-flow layouts keep their current behavior.

## 2.13.1

### Patch Changes

- 400863f: Define Screen scroll ownership explicitly: normal screens own scrolling, while `scroll={false}` preserves a bounded viewport for child-owned scroll and gesture surfaces. Require `@ankhorage/surface` 2.2.1 or newer so Stack preserves direct-child flex and min-size semantics throughout that viewport chain.

## 2.13.0

### Minor Changes

- 04e4124: Make Image a first-class manifest-authoring node backed by canonical media metadata, with image-kind constraints and shared static metadata across the standard and bindable registries.

## 2.12.0

### Minor Changes

- 7524b66: Resolve canonical persisted theme recipe overrides through ZORA-owned metadata, preserve full ThemeConfig across theme scopes, and make explicit component props override inherited recipe defaults without pinning theme-owned values into new manifest blueprints.

## 2.11.0

### Minor Changes

- b7ae65d: Make ThemeModeToggle manifest-authorable by registering it in the runtime component registry, publishing static authoring metadata, and supporting interaction-policy injection.

## 2.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 3c1f70f: Add a reusable `ThemeModeToggle` that switches the canonical ZORA light/dark runtime mode with accessible sun/moon affordances.

## 2.9.3

### Patch Changes

- 72f5814: Classify Heading content and semantics for instance authoring while keeping visual presentation under component theme authority.

## 2.9.2

### Patch Changes

- 2f1bf27: Add canonical prop authoring authority metadata and a separate ZORA-owned component and pattern theme recipe metadata registry.

## 2.9.1

### Patch Changes

- 8a9cd02: Update packages
- f63b36a: update packages

## 2.9.0

### Minor Changes

- a561fbb: Enforce uniform `interactionPolicy` support across all public registry components, with a compile-time contract invariant, and correct `ConfirmDialog` to forward callbacks unchanged.

## 2.8.7

### Patch Changes

- 45cd65a: Make the public ZORA component registry type readonly and verify the actual registry object in tests.

## 2.8.6

### Patch Changes

- 2c162c8: Export the canonical ZORA component registry for runtime renderer composition.

## 2.8.5

### Patch Changes

- 355af5a: Update SURFACE with the color inverse fix where e.g. Tooltip showed black on black (not readable)

## 2.8.4

### Patch Changes

- a77e5bd: Fix DatePicker, ThemeComposer, and form controller state synchronization to comply with React Hooks correctness rules without disabling lint checks.

## 2.8.3

### Patch Changes

- f443bc1: update DEVTOOLS

## 2.8.2

### Patch Changes

- 4be3f5b: Require the native modules that are always reachable from the root Zora entrypoint instead of describing them as optional integrations.

## 2.8.1

### Patch Changes

- 65f2008: Tmp installation of expo-linear-gradient package before extraction of gradient plugin

## 2.8.0

### Minor Changes

- be736ad: Add a generic ProductCard pattern for commerce and catalog items.

## 2.7.3

### Patch Changes

- 3155142: Update CONTRACTS

## 2.7.2

### Patch Changes

- d84eb54: Fix `DisclosureSection` header interaction and long-description layout so the main header area toggles open/closed, long text wraps, and the trailing chevron remains visible.

## 2.7.1

### Patch Changes

- 8ebfa92: Update CONTRACTS

## 2.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 17287a0: Add ZORA scanner UI patterns: BarcodeScannerView, CameraPermissionView, and ScanOverlay.

## 2.6.1

### Patch Changes

- 77fa4f9: Register `Progress` as a direct manifest-capable ZORA component with serializable metadata props and blueprint defaults.

## 2.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 4687a8a: Add reusable OAuth provider button and list auth patterns.

## 2.5.5

### Patch Changes

- 64282a1: Add Gradient and SplashScreen components for branded loading and preview surfaces.

## 2.5.4

### Patch Changes

- eab78b8: Add a canonical basic app usage example for generated documentation and configure Paradox to render it from real source.

  The example demonstrates the intended ZORA app root composition with `ZoraProvider`, `AppShell`, `AppBar`, `Screen`, and `ScreenSection`, and the Expo showcase now aligns its shell header with the same `AppBar`-based structure.

## 2.5.3

### Patch Changes

- 66fe27e: Add Paradox `@readme` coverage for the full public ZORA UI surface.

## 2.5.2

## 2.4.3

### Patch Changes

- 2c47d0b: Align Notice metadata with its public color prop.

## 2.4.2

### Patch Changes

- a1934d8: Add Skeleton loading primitives for placeholder card, list, and text states.

## 2.4.1

### Patch Changes

- 2fdb077: Expose a ZORA Toast API backed by the existing Surface Toast implementation.

## 2.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 3c5b384: Remove raw `style` and `bodyStyle` escape hatches from `AppShell`. AppShell remains a structural app frame; layout customization should happen through composed ZORA primitives instead of arbitrary root/body style overrides.

## 2.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 8810525: Add `ButtonGroup` for grouped action layouts such as dialog footers, form actions, card footers, and responsive mobile action stacks.

## 2.2.0

### Minor Changes

- f4d075b: Remove `AuthLayout` from the public API. Compose focused auth or onboarding screens directly with existing layout primitives such as `Center`, `Card`, and `Stack`.

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- cc3d18a: Add component event metadata types and initial event descriptors for form submit, button press, and collection item press events.

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- b832d62: Replace ZORA `tone` APIs with Surface-derived `color` and `emphasis` models across components, patterns, and recipes.

  Breaking changes:
  - Removed `ZoraTone` from the public API.
  - Added Surface-derived public color model exports:
    - `ZoraPaletteColor`, `ZoraStatusColor`, `ZoraColor`, `ZoraEmphasis`
    - `ZORA_PALETTE_COLORS`, `ZORA_STATUS_COLORS`, `ZORA_COLORS`, `ZORA_EMPHASES`
  - Updated semantic props from `tone` to `color` for components and patterns that select semantic color roles.
  - Updated text-like APIs to use `emphasis` for content contrast.

  Migration:
  - Replace semantic `tone` props with `color`.
  - Replace text/heading contrast values (`default`, `muted`, `subtle`, `inverse`) to `emphasis`.
  - Keep `tone` only where it represents card-style visual treatment (`ZoraCardTone`).

### Patch Changes

- 02629b6: Update SURFACE

## 1.5.1

### Patch Changes

- 07e9d96: Improve realistic example app chrome by adding compact AppBars with dark-mode toggles, applying semantic Screen backgrounds, and fixing native ZoraTabBar icon/label rendering.

## 1.5.0

### Minor Changes

- f3c2822: Replace the web-oriented `Page` / `PageHeader` / `PageSection` layout model with the native-app-oriented `Screen` / `ScreenSection` model.

  `Screen` is the default scroll owner for normal app screens, while `AppBar` owns the active screen title and screen-level actions. `ScreenSection` replaces page sections as the content grouping primitive inside app screens.

## 1.4.12

### Patch Changes

- 6220959: Add realistic category-based example apps and a scaffold script for creating real Expo Router + React Native Web + ZORA apps.

  The new examples live under `examples/<app-category>/<example-id>/` and use real Expo Router route files, real tab navigation through `ZoraTabBar`, and ZORA-only UI without `StyleSheet`, direct Surface imports, or local styling workaround layers.

  Included examples:
  - `social_community/community-feed`
  - `social_community/photo-social`
  - `social_community/private-messaging`
  - `social_community/visual-discovery`
  - `shopping_commerce/marketplace`
  - `shopping_commerce/storefront`
  - `food_drink/restaurant`

  The examples also document current ZORA product gaps, including future needs for product cards, product grids, menu item cards, reservation summaries, visual wall/grid patterns, and richer chat/status patterns.

## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes

- d4df5a0: Plan 5 — Semantic theme usage audit

  Audited all ZORA components, layouts, and patterns for consistent use of the
  post-Plan-3/Plan-4 theme model.
  - Confirmed: no stale references to `colorTone`, `ZoraColorTone`, `ZORA_COLOR_TONES`,
    `ZoraColorHarmony`, `ZORA_COLOR_HARMONIES`, `ZoraHexColor`, `AnkhTheme`, direct
    `culori` imports, `ThemeComposerRecommendation`, or local color-math APIs remain in
    src, examples, or README.
  - Fixed: layouts, patterns, and components that used `Box`, `Stack`, `Center`, and
    `Container` imported directly from `@ankhorage/surface` have been updated to import
    from the ZORA foundation layer (`../../foundation`) in line with the Surface import
    policy. Foundation wrappers, theme infrastructure, and Surface-wrapping leaf
    components remain unchanged.
  - Added regression-guard tests in `src/audit.test.ts` covering all required search
    patterns so that stale APIs and bypass imports are caught automatically in CI.
  - All components, layouts, and patterns verified against the current Surface/ZORA
    semantic token model; no hard-coded color literals found in runtime component code.

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 938bcfe: ThemeComposer now edits the full ZoraTheme source model.
  - ThemeComposer adds name editing with empty-name validation.
  - ThemeComposer adds app category editing via a Select using APP_CATEGORIES from @ankhorage/contracts.
  - ThemeComposer supports optional `appCategories` prop for narrowing the category options list.
  - ThemeComposer validates primary color input with parseHexColorOrThrow from @ankhorage/color-theory while keeping public `primaryColor` as `string`.
  - ThemeComposer preview shows name, appCategory, primaryColor, and harmony metadata.
  - README and examples app updated to reflect the new API.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 4d50ada: **Breaking: ZORA core theme model and color stack cleanup**

  ## Removed APIs
  - `ZoraTheme.colorTone` — removed; `colorTone` is no longer part of the theme seed
  - `ZoraColorTone` type — removed
  - `ZORA_COLOR_TONES` constant — removed
  - `ZoraHexColor` type — removed; ZORA themes now accept normal string hex values
  - `ZoraComputedTheme.mode` — replaced by `light` and `dark` mode objects
  - `ThemeComposerRecommendation` — removed
  - `ThemeComposerAppMood` — removed
  - `ThemeComposerAppCategory` — removed (was an opaque `string` alias)
  - `ThemeComposerProps.appMood` — removed
  - `ThemeComposerProps.recommendations` — removed
  - Internal color stack (`src/internal/color/`) — removed; ZORA no longer owns color math

  ## Added / Changed APIs
  - `ZoraTheme.name` — now **required** (was optional); ZORA themes must provide a real display name
  - `ZoraTheme.appCategory` — new required field; use `AppCategory` from `@ankhorage/contracts`
  - `ZoraTheme.primaryColor` — remains a public `string`; ZORA validates it internally with `@ankhorage/color-theory`
  - `ZoraComputedTheme` — now has `light: ZoraComputedThemeMode` and `dark: ZoraComputedThemeMode` instead of a single `mode`
  - `ZoraComputedThemeMode` — new type: `{ mode, surfaceTheme, generated, swatches, semanticColors? }`
  - Primary color is now preserved identically for both light and dark `ThemeConfig` modes (no dark-mode mutation)
  - `SurfaceTheme` (from `@ankhorage/surface`) replaces `AnkhTheme` as the resolved runtime theme type

  ## New dependencies
  - `@ankhorage/color-theory@^0.0.2` — canonical color types and generation utilities
  - `@ankhorage/contracts@^1.1.0` — theme config and app category types

  ## Removed dependencies
  - `culori` — no longer a direct ZORA dependency; color math is delegated to `@ankhorage/color-theory`
  - `@types/culori` — removed

  ## Migration

  ```ts
  // Before
  const theme: ZoraTheme = {
    id: 'my-theme',
    name: 'My Theme',
    primaryColor: '#0f766e',
    harmony: 'analogous',
    colorTone: 'jewel',
  };

  // After
  const theme: ZoraTheme = {
    id: 'my-theme',
    name: 'My Theme',
    appCategory: 'developer_tools',
    primaryColor: '#0f766e',
    harmony: 'analogous',
  };
  ```

  The `name` field is now required. `primaryColor` stays app-facing and ergonomic as
  a string, while ZORA validates it when converting the source theme to a runtime
  `ThemeConfig`.
